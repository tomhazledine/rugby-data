# Rugby Data

A React app to explore stats from the 6 Nations championship.

## Ideas

* Italy have no effect?

Do Italy have any measurable impact on the rest of the tournament? Does the median score change consistently for all teams when Italy matches are removed from stats?

* Average winning margin. Separate wins and losses; are there teams that win by small margins but lose by big ones? Or vica-versa?

* Median winning score vs. median losing score

* home vs away: win/loss percentages. When the margins are tight (final scores less than 7 points difference) are teams more likely to win at home or away? Or are away wins more likely to be close?
